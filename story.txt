Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. Jack's best friend, 
was strangley enough, a fox also named Jack. Jack lived in New York 
City, and he could always find Jack the fox wandering around Central 
Park. Jack would walk through the park and whistle for Jack the fox, and 
he'd always trot over to him. 

One day, the boy jack got sick. The fox was worried because it had not seen the boy for several days.
It found the boy's home, and found him lying in bed very ill.
The fox wanted to do something for him.
