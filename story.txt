Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. Jack's best friend, 
was strangley enough, a fox also named Jack. Jack lived in New York 
City, and he could always find Jack the fox wandering around Central 
Park. Jack would walk through the park and whistle for Jack the fox, and 
he'd always trot over to him. 

One day, the boy jack got sick. The fox was worried because it had not seen the boy for several days.
It found the boy's home, and found him lying in bed very ill.
The fox wanted to do something for him.


The fox traveled far and wide for the antidote for the Jack's poison, up a mountain,
across the wide open seas, only to see Jack alive for one more day.

The fox finally got the anidote for Jack, it hurried back. When it arrived at Jack's home, it disppointedly found that
Jack has already recovered. And he also has new friend who is also a fox, he named it Jack-2. Jack the fox was so upset
that it swore it will never talk to Jack again.
