Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. Jack's best friend,
was strangley enough, a fox also named Jack. Jack lived in New York City, 
and he could always find Jack the fox wandering around Central Park. Jack 
would walk through the park and whistle for Jack the fox, and he'd always 
trot over to him.
